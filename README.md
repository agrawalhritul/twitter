Python Twitter Scraping

We have to register ourselves as a Twitter Developer.
Then we have to register our application and state the use of API access. 
We will be provided with Access token and Consumer Key. Those are to be kept secret and pasted in the credentials file.

Then we need to install the following two packages:
1. tweepy
2. csv

Using tweepy, we can get various informations about a user by providing their twitter user_id.
csv package has to be installed so that the scraped data can be stored in an ordered format.
